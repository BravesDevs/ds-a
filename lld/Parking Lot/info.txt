A: I need 4 classes, one is ParkingSpot, one is Vehicle, one is ParkingLot, and one is ParkingFloor.

    ParkingSpot is a individual parking spot, with row, column, floor, and type

    ParkingFloor is collection of parking spots and managing the free spots

    ParkingLot is collection of parking floors and managing the Vehicle parking and unparking

    Vehicle is a vehicle with license plate, type, and size and represents parked vehicle

B: Key Operations

1. Park(vehicleType, vehicleNumber, ticketId, strategy)
2. removeVehicle(ticketId/spotId)
3. searchVehicle(ticketId/vehicleNumber)
4. getFreeSpots(floor, vehicleId)

C: Parking strategy
1. Low index first: Prioritize the parking spot with low index of floor, row, column
2. Most free spots first: Chooses the floor with most free spots
